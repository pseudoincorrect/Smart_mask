# SMART MASK

Smart Mask (project name will surely change) is an embedded system connected to a mobile app to monitor health status with our custom printed sensors.

This System is divided into 3 parts (hence 3 folders here):
- The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the embedded system, made with Altium Designer
- The embedded system, written in C (working with Nordic SDK)
- A Flutter application, bluetooth connection and data storage/presentation
