# SMART MASK

Smart Mask (project name will surely change) is a embedded system connected to a mobile app to monitor the
printed sensors we are currently working.

This System is divided into 3 parts (hence 3 folders here):
    - The Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for the embedded system, made with Altium Designer
    - The embedded system, written in C (working with Nordic SDK)
    - A Flutter application, bluetooth connection and data storage/presentation
