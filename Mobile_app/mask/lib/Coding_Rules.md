# CODING RULES FOR THIS PROJECT

> Of course these rules are subjectives.
> However Let's keep things consistent by following them.
---

### ADD A DESCRIPTION ATOP OF EACH FILES


### WORK ALONG THE TODO FILE 
> LOCATED IN THIS FOLDER

 
### KEEP NAMES EXPLICIT 
> "sensorEnumToString()" is much better than "SeEnToStr()"
> https://medium.com/coding-skills/clean-code-101-meaningful-names-and-functions-bf450456d90c


### DO NOT WRITE CODE YOU DON'T NEED 
> If you do not modify data base tables, do not write a update() function
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it


### ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESS LOGIC (BLOC), ADD A DESCRIPTION FOR EACH FUNCTION
> with docstring ///
> https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation


### REFACTOR TO KEEP THE CODE CLEAN 
> No long function


### BE CONSISTENT WITH CODE FORMATING 
> Letter case, indentations
> https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style


### USE COMMENTS WISELY 
> Better to add a description atop a function than comments in it
> https://www.todaysoftmag.com/article/1120/clean-code-comments-and-formatting


### REMOVE PRINT STATEMENT AS SOON AS YOU CAN


### ORGANISE CODE FILES INTO RELEVANT FOLDERS 
> Rather than one folder with many loosely related files in it


### USE TYPING RATHER THAN DYNAMIC TYPING
> num, String, List<>
