                    CODING RULES FOR THIS PROJECT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

// Of course these rules are subjectives.
// However Let's keep things consistent by following them.


ADD A DESCRIPTION AT THE TOP OF EACH FILES


WORK ALONG THE TODO FILE (LOCATED IN THIS FOLDER)


KEEP NAME EXPLICIT "SENSORENUMTOSTRING()" IS MUCH BETTER THAN "SENTOSTR()
        https://medium.com/coding-skills/clean-code-101-meaningful-names-and-functions-bf450456d90c


DO NOT WRITE CODE YOU DON'T NEED 
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it
        (If you do not modify data base tables, do not write a update() function


ESPECIALLY FOR BUSINESS LOGIC (BLOC), ADD A DESCRIPTION FOR EACH FUNCTION
        https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/documentation
        with docstring ///


REFACTOR TO KEEP THE CODE CLEAN 
    (No long function)


BE CONSISTENT WITH CODE FORMATING 
        https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style
        (Letter case, indentations)


USE COMMENTS WISELY 
        https://www.todaysoftmag.com/article/1120/clean-code-comments-and-formatting
        (Better to add a description atop a function than comments in it)


REMOVE PRINT STATEMENT AS SOON AS YOU CAN


ORGANISE CODE FILES INTO RELEVANT FOLDERS 
        (Rather than one folder with many loosely related files in it)


USE TYPING (NUM, STRING, LIST<>) RATHER THAN DYNAMIC TYPING
