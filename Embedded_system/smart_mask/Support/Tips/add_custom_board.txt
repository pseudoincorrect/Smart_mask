open "board.h" (in the SDK) file

add the following lines after the last "#elif" 
    #elif defined (CUSTOM_BOARD_INC)
        #include STRINGIFY(CUSTOM_BOARD_INC.h)

replace CUSTOM_BOARD_INC with your board name for which you have a .h file in ${PROJ_ROOT)/src/boards/

in the project file "ble_mask.emProject" modify the c_preprocessor_definitions in order to select the board you want to use in "boards.h"
